# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in different programming languages.

## Python

The `python` directory contains solutions implemented in Python. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

### Key Features of Python
- Easy to learn and read
- Extensive standard library
- Dynamic typing
- Object-oriented programming support
- Functional programming capabilities

### Common Python Libraries and Built-in Modules Used
- `heapq`: A built-in module for heap queue algorithm implementation
- Standard data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- String manipulation functions
- List comprehensions
- Lambda functions

### Python Best Practices
1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Follow PEP 8 style guide
3. Write docstrings for functions and classes
4. Use type hints for better code readability
5. Implement proper error handling

### Running Python Code
```python
# Basic Python file execution
python filename.py

# Using Python interactive shell
python
>>> # Your code here
```

### Development Environment
- Python 3.x
- Any text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Virtual environment recommended for dependency management
